# # Minesweeper – Java GUI (Learning Project)

This hobby project was created to explore Java GUI programming (Swing) and to implement the **flood fill algorithm** used in Minesweeper-style games.

## Purpose
The main focus was learning:
- Java Swing for GUI development
- Flood fill algorithm for revealing connected empty cells

## Status
- The flood fill algorithm works well.
- The overall game logic is incomplete and contains bugs.
- Development was not continued, as the project’s goal was to practice specific concepts rather than produce a finished game.
- The game is not heavily documented
